Brief Document about timings

I've generically optimized my code to calculate both the minimum and maximum
distances within the same function. This seems to have cut the time from a
37 second processing (two seperate functions) down to approximately 17 seconds.
Not much was changed. But the functions were condensed into one single code.
Max distance and min distance were defined first. then the rest of the
calculations were carried out as normal.
