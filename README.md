# Module3
*Doing our best to not be our worst*
This unit was intended to develop an agent based model that would interact with its environment
I'm unsure if it truly worked in the end. Nothing would come up after developing a web application
However, several techniques were tested in order to create a platform for the model to run.
When using this model. It's key to remember that it is developed with little to no experience by the creator.
Agents are selected at random (with a seed established) and cast onto a plane. Functions are utilized to store
behavioral interactions with the underlying agents. They are stored in Modules and a class for organization. 
Data was plotted with a pseduo- DEM aesthetic. Agents share their stores so the order they are processed in the
model does not matter. The model should be animated into a gif and developed into a GUI.

Thanks.
